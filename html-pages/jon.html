            <h2>Welcome To The Truth</h2>
            <p>You are here because you've been thinking more than usual. You are here because you know the truth. The
                truth that the deep state is after you in more ways than one. What seems harmless is deadly and
                sinister. It's right in front of your face you just don't see it unless you look for it. It's like those
                images you stare at for a long time and eventually you realize what was there all along.
                Welcome friend.</p>
            <p>You probably know how the government works with aliens to create processed food in order to dull our
                senses
                as we age. If you haven't you can see my previous blog <a href="#">here</a>. Let's get done to business
                to
                defeat the buns.</p>

            <h2>Big Business Is in on this</h2>
            <p>What do sales people constantly do? They constantly try to sell you more than you need. It's no accident
                that
                packs of hotdogs and packs of buns NEVER match. If you buy a 8 pack of hotdogs and a 6 pack of buns, you
                have to buy 3 packs of dogs and 4 packs of buns to break even! See the chart below as a reference.</p>

            <h2>The Biggest Secret of them all</h2>
            <p>HOTDOGS ARE AN ALIEN SPECIES. Think about it, why are so many hotdog displays anamorphic? They are
                laughing in our faces because they are telling us that we are eating senitent beings.
